    //   "backgroundDescription": "As a group project, I collaborated with two other women in my bootcamp to make Zaza come to life, a full-stack lingerie and fragrance store. Our intention was to create a site geared towards primarily women and female sensuality. The goal was to make the site look real, professional, and authentic and to include stripe for card payments. We each had our own responsibilities in the project, and it was through good communication, frequent updates and meetings, and togetherness that we were able to complete the project by the deadline. In the future, we seek to include men's wear for more inclusivity as well as customer review sections per product displayed."

I was inspired by Rainmeter and wanted to create a similar aesthetic, thus Lofi Train was born."
