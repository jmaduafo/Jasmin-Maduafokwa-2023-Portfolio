      "backgroundDescription": "As a group project, I collaborated with two other women in my bootcamp to make Zaza come to life. Since the bootcamp was 90% male, we wanted to make a site geared towards primarily women and female sensuality. The goal was to make the site look real, professional, and authentic and to include stripe for card payments. We each had our own responsibilities in the project, and it was through good communication, frequent updates and meetings, and togetherness that we were able to complete the project by the deadline. In the future, we seek to include men's wear for more inclusivity as well as customer review sections per product displayed."

      "backgroundDescription": "This application was designed and developed by myself as part of my role as a frontend intern at Baud Technologies. Being a bit of a perfectionist, I wanted the website to look good and professional and to match the overall feel of what my employer was going for. His desire was for his company website to be a single-page website with a scientific vibe. I incorporated the requirements that he set, but I also wanted to elevate it using GSAP, adding a bit of my own spin visually. I was thinking about Star Trek and UFOs while designing the site, and as a result, my employer was extremely satisfied with the end product."

      "backgroundDescription": "Lofi Train is a personal side project that's surrounded by one of my favorite hobbies: music, specifically lofi music. Lofi brings a calm, serene energy that helps to balance out mental strain, especially when going through a stressful time or being absorbed in work. I wanted there to be a place for users to be absorbed in that feeling of inner peace that can mediate their feelings of stress. I was inspired by Rainmeter and wanted to create a similar aesthetic, thus Lofi Train was born."
